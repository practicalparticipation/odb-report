## About the Open Data Barometer project

The Open Data Barometer aims to uncover the true prevalence and impact
of open data initiatives around the world. It analyses global trends,
and also ranks countries and regions via an in-depth methodology that
considers: readiness to secure the benefits of open data; actual levels
of implementation; and the impact of such initiatives. 

This is the pilot edition of the Open Data Barometer. This report also
marks the first large-scale research collaboration between the Open Data
Institute and the World Wide Web Foundation.

## About the Web Foundation

Established by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the [World Wide Web Foundation](http://www.webfoundation.org) seeks to establish the open Web as a global public
good and a basic right, creating a world where everyone, everywhere can use the Web to communicate, collaborate and innovate freely.

We work with others to make the web truly universal, open and free, through initiatives such as the [Alliance for Affordable Internet](http://www.a4ai.org), which aims to bring down the cost of internet access, and [the Web Index](http://www.thewebindex.org), which tracks the health and utility of the Web in over 80 countries. 

We also put the open web to work to strengthen democracy and participation, especially by helping to harness the power of open data.
