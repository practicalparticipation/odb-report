Open Data Barometer Report
==========

In 2013 the [Open Data Barometer](http://www.opendatabarometer.org) report was written in Word, and converted to PDF. 

This was, [as has been pointed out](https://twitter.com/philipashlock/status/418826517255163904), not ideal for a report about open data - but it was being reviewed by lots of different people - and this ended up as the lowest-common-denominator format for producing the report to a deadline.

But - we want to do better next year at using open tools all through the Open Data Barometer process. So - we've been experimenting with how to present the 2013 report as HTML, as part of learning about how we might work in future.

I'll be using this as a test-bed for trying out ways of marking up the report and driving diagrams and other elements direct from the underlying data. 

Suggestions, feedback and improvements welcome.
